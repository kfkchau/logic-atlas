# üìò Logic Atlas ‚Äì Documentation Strategy & Governance

This document defines the structure, naming conventions, and governance logic for all documentation within the Logic Atlas system.

## üì¶ Sub-Framework Format

Each sub-framework must follow this 8-section format:

1. **Purpose** ‚Äì What the framework is for  
2. **Core Dimensions** ‚Äì Classification axes  
3. **Definitions** ‚Äì Clear logic for each category  
4. **Examples** ‚Äì Real-world use cases  
5. **Integration Points** ‚Äì How it connects to other frameworks  
6. **Visual Schema** ‚Äì Diagram or layout logic  
7. **Update History** ‚Äì Version tracking  
8. **Tags / Typing** ‚Äì Metadata for tagging and modeling

## üõ°Ô∏è Rule Enforcement

All documentation must comply with `chatrules`, including:

- No omission
- Live synchronization
- MECE compliance
- Update logging
- Issue detection during output
- Redirect logic
- Temporal and appendix reminders

## üîÑ Update & Export Protocols

- All updates must be logged in `logic-atlas-changelog.md`
- All sub-frameworks must include version markers
- All exports must preserve full logic (no simplification)
