**Verb/Action Tagging Framework**

This framework categorizes verbs/actions based on two dimensions: Movement (MV, NM) and Transformation (TF, NT). The goal is to identify whether an action involves physical movement or not, as well as any transformation or change in state.

**Movement Dimension:**

* **MV**: Moving, transporting, transferring
	+ Examples:
		- "The package is being delivered." [ MV ]
		- "She moved her belongings into a new apartment." [ MV ]
		- "He transported his car to another location." [ MV ]
* **NM**: Not moving, stationary
	+ Examples:
		- "The book remains on the shelf." [ NM ]
		- "Her thoughts are still the same." [ NM ]

**Transformation Dimension:**

* **TF**: Transforming, altering, modifying
	+ Examples:
		- Change in physical form or substance
		- Improvement or enhancement of a skill or ability
		- Conversion from one state to another (e.g., energy conversion)
* **NT**: Not transforming (no change in state)
	+ Examples:
		- No change in physical form, substance, or state

**Combining Movement and Transformation:**

* **MV, TF**: Moving while transforming
	+ Examples:
		- "She traveled to a new city for work and got a promotion." [ MV, TF ] (Note: This example is still ambiguous)
* **MV, NT**: Moving without transformation
	+ Examples:
		- "He moved his belongings into a storage unit." [ MV, NT ]
		- "She transferred her files to an external hard drive." [ MV, NT ]
