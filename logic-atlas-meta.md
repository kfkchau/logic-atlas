# üß† Logic Atlas ‚Äì Meta-Framework

Logic Atlas is the meta-framework that governs how all sub-frameworks interconnect, synchronize, and evolve. It defines shared logic, integration rules, glossary references, update protocols, and documentation governance.

| Activity Relationship Framework     | logic-atlas-activity.md          |
| Action Classification Framework     | logic-atlas-action.md            |
| Resource Typology Framework         | logic-atlas-resource.md          |
| Enforcement Logic Framework         | logic-atlas-enforcement.md       |

## üîó Integration Logic

Each framework is interoperable through shared tagging, structural logic, and quantification.

- Activity Relationship Framework uses:
  - Action Classification Framework for verb tagging
  - Resource Typology Framework for object classification
  - Quantification Schema Framework for L/W/H tagging
  - Enforcement Logic Framework for rule linkage
  - Relationship Architecture Framework for flow mapping
  - Relational Geometry Framework for spatial overlays
  - Resource Part Typology Framework for scoped targeting
  - Connection Logic Framework for conditional chaining

- Enforcement Logic Framework links enforcement nodes to activities and resources

- Quantification Schema Framework applies metrics across actions, activities, enforcement, and flows

- Relational Geometry Framework enables spatial reasoning for parts and entities

- Resource Part Typology Framework scopes resource segments used in activities, enforcement, and measurement
---

## üìö Shared Glossary

All frameworks reference a centralized glossary in `logic-atlas-glossary.md`. This includes:

- Common terms (e.g. Actor, Component, Enforcement Node)
- Tag definitions (e.g. MV, TF, RQ, EV, CP)
- Typing logic (e.g. resource types, activity types, spatial states)

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Rule Enforcement

All logic must comply with `chatrules`, including:

- No Omission Rule ‚Äî no simplification or exclusion of logic
- Live Synchronization ‚Äî all updates propagate to meta
- Issue Detection ‚Äî gaps flagged during ingestion and output
- Change Logging ‚Äî all updates recorded in `logic-atlas-changelog.md`
- Standard Format ‚Äî all sub-frameworks follow the 8-section structure

---

## üß© Visual Schema Governance

Visual logic is centralized in `logic-atlas-visual.md`, including:

- Activity flow diagrams
- Enforcement chains
- Relationship maps
- Resource part overlays
- Quantification plots

---

## üîÑ Update Protocols

- All updates must be logged in `logic-atlas-changelog.md`
- All sub-frameworks must include version markers
- All exports must preserve full logic (no simplification)
- All redirects (e.g. glossary terms, visual schemas) must be tracked

## üß† Purpose of Logic Atlas

To ensure that the system remains:

- Modular ‚Äî each framework is standalone but interoperable
- MECE-aligned ‚Äî all classification systems are exhaustive and exclusive
- Governed ‚Äî all logic is tracked, versioned, and rule-compliant
- Extensible ‚Äî new frameworks and logic layers can be added without disruption
