# 🧠 Logic Atlas System

Logic Atlas is a modular, interoperable framework for modeling complex systems, activities, relationships, and enforcement logic. It is designed to support structured reasoning, tagging, simulation, and diagnostics across digital, policy, and operational domains.

---

## 📌 What Is Logic Atlas?

Logic Atlas is built from seven core sub-frameworks, each covering a distinct dimension of logic:

| Framework | Domain | Core Dimensions | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|------------------|---------|
| **Activity Relationship Framework** | Activity Modeling | Actor, Action, Object, Target | Structuring agency and directionality |
| **Action Classification Framework** | Action Tagging | Movement × Transformation | Tagging verbs/actions in workflows |
| **Resource Typology Framework** | Resource Classification | Consumability × Physicality | Tagging and planning resource types |
| **Enforcement Logic Framework** | Enforcement Modeling | Scope × Mechanism + Source + Strength | Modeling requirement enforcement |
| **Quantification Schema Framework** | Universal Measurement | Length × Width × Height | Measuring entities, activities, flows |
| **Relationship Architecture Framework** | Structural Mapping | Hierarchical × Network × System | Mapping influence and flow |
| **Relational Geometry Framework** | Spatial Relationships | Unrelated, Adjacent, Intersecting, Nested, Embedded | Diagnosing entity proximity |

All frameworks are MECE-aligned, interoperable, and designed for composability.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To begin using Logic Atlas:

1. **Explore the sub-frameworks** — Each is documented in its own formal `.md` file.
2. **Use tagging logic** — Apply movement, transformation, and quantification tags to actions and resources.
3. **Model activities** — Use the Activity Relationship Framework to structure Actor → Action → Object → Target chains.
4. **Apply enforcement** — Use the Enforcement Logic Framework to define rules, consequences, and escalation logic.
5. **Use spatial reasoning** — Apply the Relational Geometry Framework to diagnose containment, adjacency, and overlap.

## 🔗 Integration Map

Logic Atlas frameworks are designed to interconnect. For example:

- The Activity Relationship Framework consumes tags from the Action Classification, Resource Typology, and Quantification Schema frameworks.
- The Enforcement Logic Framework links condition and outcome activities from the activity framework.
- The Relational Geometry Framework overlays spatial logic on resources and activities.
- The Relationship Architecture Framework defines the architecture of flows between entities.

See **Meta-Framework Overview** (`logic-atlas-meta.md`) for full integration logic.

## 📊 Benchmarking

Logic Atlas has been benchmarked against leading modeling and architecture frameworks including TOGAF, BPMN, ArchiMate, UML, and OPA. It stands out for its MECE enforcement, quantification schema, spatial reasoning, and governance structure.

**Compared Frameworks**
- **TOGAF** – The Open Group Architecture Framework
- **Zachman Framework**
- **BPMN** – Business Process Model and Notation
- **ArchiMate**
- **UML** – Unified Modeling Language
- **OPA** – Open Policy Agent
