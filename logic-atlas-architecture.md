## üß† Universal Relationship Schema ‚Äì Architecture Logic

**Alias**: `ST`  
**Formal Name**: Universal Relationship Schema ‚Äì Architecture Logic  

---

### 1. üß© Purpose

To model relationships between entities using three foundational architectures‚ÄîHierarchical, Network, and System. This schema enables directional mapping of influence, authority, trust, and flow across organizational, technical, and conceptual domains.

### 2. üß† Core Dimensions

| **Architecture** | **Definition** | **Tag** |
|------------------|----------------|---------|
| `hierarchy`      | Top-down structure based on authority | `HR` |
| `network`        | Peer-based structure based on trust or mutual access | `NT` |
| `system`         | Flow-based structure with dynamic feedback | `SY` |

---

### 3. üìö Definitions

- **Hierarchical**: Relationships defined by control, command, or reporting lines.
- **Network**: Relationships defined by mutual access, trust, or informal influence.
- **System**: Relationships defined by dynamic flows (e.g. data, feedback, resources) across nodes.

### 4. üß™ Examples

| **Scenario** | **Architecture** | **Notes** |
|--------------|------------------|-----------|
| Manager ‚Üí Staff | `hierarchy` | Formal reporting line |
| Team ‚Üî Team | `network` | Peer collaboration |
| Data ‚Üí Process ‚Üí Output | `system` | Flow of information |
| Trust between agencies | `network` | Informal influence |
| Feedback loop in policy | `system` | Dynamic adjustment mechanism |

URM (Universal Relationship Mapper) example:  
> Obama ‚Üí Biden, Sebelius ‚Üí Hierarchy  
> Fauci ‚Üî CDC ‚Üí Network  
> Sebelius ‚Üí Guidance ‚Üí Task Force ‚Üí Obama ‚Üí Exec Orders ‚Üí Sebelius ‚Üí System

### 5. üîó Integration Points

| **Framework** | **Integration Type** | **Connection** |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Universal Activity Schema ‚Äì Directional Logic | Flow Mapping | Activities are linked via relationship flows |
| Universal Enforcement Schema ‚Äì Conditional Outcome Logic | Structural Context | Enforcement logic follows relationship architecture |
| Universal Measurement Schema ‚Äì Quantification Logic | Flow Metrics | Relationship flows can be tagged with Length, Width, Height |
| Universal Relational Geometry ‚Äì Spatial Logic | Spatial Mapping | Relationship lines can be spatially contextualized |
| Universal Conditional Logic ‚Äì Activity Linkage | Flow Logic | ST defines the architecture of conditional chains |
| Universal Resource Schema ‚Äì Classification Logic | Flow Carrier | Resources move through relationship lines (e.g. trust, authority) |

### 6. üß≠ Visual Schema (Described)

- **Nodes**: Entities (e.g. people, systems, resources)
- **Edges**: Relationship lines labeled as `HR`, `NT`, or `SY`
- **Flow Arrows**: Directional indicators for system flows
- **Overlay Tags**: Optional Venn2 spatial context or MS quantification
- **URM Layout**: Multi-layered map showing hierarchical, network, and system overlays

### 7. üïì Update History
- Created during ingestion of PR-ST c 3.docx, PR-ST c 4.docx, PR-ST c 5.docx, PR-ST c 6.docx
- Refined with URM schema and flow logic
- Standardized under coremd-plan format
- Integrated with enforcement, measurement, and conditional logic frameworks
