# 📊 Logic Atlas – Benchmarking Against Leading Frameworks

This document compares Logic Atlas against other well-known modeling and architecture frameworks, highlighting its unique capabilities and positioning.

---

## 🔍 Compared Frameworks

- **TOGAF** – The Open Group Architecture Framework
- **Zachman Framework**
- **BPMN** – Business Process Model and Notation
- **ArchiMate**
- **UML** – Unified Modeling Language
- **OPA** – Open Policy Agent

## 📐 Benchmark Comparison Table

| Dimension | Logic Atlas | TOGAF | BPMN | ArchiMate | OPA | UML |
|----------|-------------|-------|------|-----------|-----|-----|
| **Modularity** | ✅ Fully modular sub-frameworks | Partial | Partial | Partial | ✅ | ✅ |
| **MECE Compliance** | ✅ Explicitly enforced | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Tagging System** | ✅ Verb, resource, spatial, enforcement tags | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Quantification Logic** | ✅ Length × Width × Height | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Spatial Reasoning** | ✅ Venn 2.0 logic | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Enforcement Modeling** | ✅ Scope × Mechanism × Source × Strength | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Activity Structure** | ✅ Actor → Action → Object → Target | Partial | ✅ | Partial | Partial | ✅ |
| **Integration Schema** | ✅ Explicit matrix and meta-framework | ❌ | ❌ | Partial | Partial | ❌ |

## 🧠 Key Differentiators

- **MECE Enforcement**: Logic Atlas is the only framework that explicitly enforces MECE logic across all dimensions.
- **Quantification Schema**: No other framework uses a universal L/W/H model for tagging entities, actions, and enforcement.
- **Spatial Logic**: Venn2 enables bottom-up spatial reasoning, which is absent in all benchmarked frameworks.
- **Governance Layer**: Logic Atlas includes a full documentation governance system (`logic-atlas-plan.md`, `logic-atlas-gaptracker.md`, etc).
